public abstract class SocketModule

	/*
	 * The class SocketModule should be thought of similarly to classes such as Block, Item, and Fluid. It's mostly a collection of
	 * hook methods that define the behavior of a specific module. Many of the hooks are quite obscure, so in most cases, you will only
	 * have to override a few of them in order to define the module's desired behavior.
	 * 
	 * You will almost always only have one instance of this class, similar to how you almost always only have one instance of a Block
	 * class. Because of this, you will never store data specific to a given module on a given socket in this class.
	 * That data should be stored in the SideConfig instance, which you will have access to in methods which it is needed.
	 * 
	 * You will see that many of the methods have 3 common parameters, a SocketTileAccess object, which allows you to access certain
	 * methods in the tile entity of the socket that a module is currently attached to (See SocketTileAccess.java),
	 * a ForgeDirection object specifying what side of the socket the module is attacked to, as well as a SideConfig object which
	 * stores what individual indicators are set to for a given side of a socket, as well as 32 bits of metadata. The SideConfig object
	 * is reset by the socket itself when module is removed or replaced so you do not have to worry about this.
	 * 
	 * You should also keep in mind if you need to store more data (for instance, if the module is a processing machine)
	 * that a socket has an ItemStack independent of the 3 internal inventories for each of the six sides. You can access this
	 * ItemStack through the field sideInventory in SocketTile Access. Just be sure that you're using the correct slot for the side
	 * of the socket you're on. They are indexed by Minecraft standard direction indexes, so ForgeDirection.ordinal() is useful
	 * for determining this. Keep in mind that ItemStacks can have NBT data, so you could potentially store quite a bit of data this way.
	 * However, if you have data that needs to be accessed FAST then you will most likely be better off mapping it to the 32 bits in
	 * SideConfig.meta. If you want to store small amounts of data, you can also try storing it in the fields of SideConfig that specify
	 * indicator states. You should, however, only do this if the module does not make that indicator visible (the socket remote only
	 * works if an indicator is visible, so you know it won't get screwed up that way).
	 * 
	 * Also keep in mind that, many of these hooks are only called server side (with a few obvious exceptions).
	 * If you need certain data sent to the client for rendering, look at the packet handling methods in SocketTileAccess.
