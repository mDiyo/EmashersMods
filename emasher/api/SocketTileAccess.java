	 * SocketTileAccess is the super class of the socket's tile entity. It's designed as an interface for modules to interact
	 * with the socket they are attached to as the full tile entity cannot be included as part of this API.
	 * 
	 * Please keep in mind that because SocketTile access extends TileEntity, you have access to the worldObj, xCoord, yCoord, zCoord
	 * fields as well as all other public fields in TileEntity through an instance of this class.
	 * 
	 * If there is something missing in this class that you need to make a module work, feel free to either ask me to add it
	 * or submit a pull request on GitHub.
